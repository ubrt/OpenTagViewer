FindMy.py defaults to five seconds total per request, which suits a desktop on a good connection

be an Anisette server in the middle generating its data on demand.

**Thirty, to match the other half of the same sign-in.** `AdiProvisioning` already uses thirty
second connect and read timeouts for the exchange it makes with Apple directly, and it is the
same network at the same moment - so the two halves having different patience only meant that
whichever ran second was the one that failed.

Measured rather than guessed: a login on an emulator with roughly 500ms round trips to Apple, and
a site-local IPv6 address that routes nowhere, spent its whole five second budget inside
happy-eyeballs and arrived as a bare `TimeoutError`. Provisioning survived the identical network.

# it is can never be matched - it is simply absent from its own candidate set, with nothing
# raising anywhere. FindMy.py's own `NearbyOfflineFindingDevice.is_from` takes the same
# precaution with the same twelve hours, and its docstring records the failure being observed on
# real hardware advertising a metre from the scanner.
#
# **Forty-eight hours, and the number is derived rather than guessed.** Alignment is written
# from `min(key_to_ind[key])` in the pinned FindMy.py's `reports.py` - deliberately the lowest
# index a matched key could belong to, because underestimating is the safe direction. For a
# secondary key that is an underestimate of real size: `keys_at` offers two secondary keys per
# index (`ind // 96 + 1` and `+ 2`), so one secondary key spans 192 primary indices. A report
# decrypted against a secondary key can therefore leave alignment up to 192 indices - 48 hours -
# below the truth, and stay there until a primary match corrects it.
#
# So the margin has to reach 48 hours or a tag aligned that way is absent from its own candidate
# set. Measured before this was understood: a tag beside the phone at -24 dBm, advertising
# steadily, sat 58 indices above where alignment believed "now" was, and the twelve hours
# FindMy.py's own `is_from` uses reaches only 48 indices.
#
# The margin is what lets such a tag be picked up again at all; `recordAccessorySeen`'s
# secondary-key floor is what pulls alignment back up afterwards, so the full width is only
# needed until the first sighting lands.
#
# Forty-eight hours off a fresh alignment is around 1150 key derivations - 1.15s on desktop
# and several times that under Chaquopy, which is why `recordAccessorySeen` takes an index

    realigning to, the same as a decrypted location report is. Without this the twelve-hour
    range is re-derived on every scan; with it, the call after a hit collapses to the three
    keys of a single index.

    **Takes the address rather than the index `currentMacAddresses` returned for it, and that
    difference is load-bearing.** That index is only trustworthy when the address came from a
    *primary* key: a primary index is unique, one key per index, so a match against it proves
    the true index outright. A secondary key covers 96 consecutive primary indices - see
    `_AccessoryKeyGenerator._secondary_keys_at` - so its index is only the first one the search
    happened to reach, not the true one. Fed to `update_alignment` without checking, that index
    can ratchet alignment past the true index in the wrong direction - measured on a real
    accessory that drifted 114 indices (28.5 hours) ahead this way and then needed a multi-day
    margin just to be found at all. The fix has to happen here rather than by filtering the map
    `currentMacAddresses` returns, because an address derived from a secondary key is still
    worth *scanning for* - only not worth *aligning to*.

    **Does not go through `update_alignment`, and that is also deliberate.** It only ever moves
    forward - correct for a fetch, where every index it sees came from searching ahead of where
    alignment already believes it is, so "never seen a lower one" is a safe rule there. A BLE
    match is not built that way: it comes from a wide, symmetric window, so a primary match can
    legitimately land below the stored alignment - proof that alignment had already drifted too
    far ahead, from an earlier secondary-key mistake or otherwise. Refusing to correct downward
    would leave that drift permanent, which is the whole failure this function exists to undo.
    So a primary match's index is written to the accessory's serialized state directly, in
    either direction.

    So this re-derives the key at `mac` itself, from scratch, and only accepts a match through
    its primary key. A secondary-only match, or no match at all (the candidate set may have
    moved on since the scan that found `mac`), records nothing.

    returns as soon as the first batch of keys yields anything - roughly the last day, since
    an AirTag steps its index every 15 minutes and Apple takes ~290 keys per request. It also
    takes no date range at all: 0.9.x removed the range parameters that 0.7.6 had.

    So asking for last Tuesday returned today's reports, which the caller then filtered away
    to nothing. The history screen showed data for today and empty days behind it, for every

    index every fifteen minutes, and on that extrapolation staying close to where the tag really
    is. Nobody has ever measured whether it does. The candidate window, the bounded slice, how
    far back a search should reach - all of it is currently sized by argument rather than by a
    number.

    An alignment that moved during a fetch is a real observation: something decrypted, so the new
    pair says where the tag actually was at a moment. Extrapolating the *old* pair forward to that
    same moment and subtracting gives the drift, as a signed number of indices, for free, on every
    fetch that finds anything.

    Positive means the extrapolation had run ahead of the tag, which is the direction that loses
    it: the search then looks above where the tag is. Around zero over weeks would mean a tag that
    is merely out of contact stays where the extrapolation says, and a search that widens downward
    is solving a problem nobody has.

    Compared this way rather than from a report's own index because the ordinary fetch never hands
    one over: `fetch_location_history(accessory)` updates the alignment inside FindMy.py, so the
    only place a report's index is visible in this file is the ranged path, which is the rarer
    half. The before-and-after pair is visible in both.

    **`source` matters more than it looks.** A fetch reading only exists for a tag the Find My
    network has seen, and the network can search around 290 keys per request, so such a tag is
    re-anchored long before it is ever lost. The question of how far a tag drifts is really a
    question about the tags the network never sees - a cellar, a workshop, no passing iPhones -
    and for those the only observation that will ever exist is a primary-key match over

    Build the files of an export bundle, for the app to zip.

    **The app is the third producer of this format**, beside the desktop wizard and its CLI, and
    it writes through the same `opentagviewer_export.build_export` they do. One implementation of
    the format is most of why that package exists: a second one in Java would drift, and the
    symptom of drift is a bundle that imports into one version of this app and not another.

    **It returns the files rather than a zip, deliberately.** `zipsink.write_zip` needs
    `pyzipper` for an encrypted archive, which is not in Chaquopy's pip list and pulls a native
    crypto dependency; the app already carries zip4j for *reading* locked bundles, and zip4j
    writes them too. So Python owns the format and Java owns the container, which is the split
    that costs nothing.

    Base64 over JSON because these are bytes crossing a language boundary. A plist is not UTF-8
    and must not be round-tripped through a string - `OwnedBeacons` records carry raw key
    material, and a lossy decode there produces a bundle that imports and then cannot locate
    anything, which is the worst kind of failure this could have.

    :param accessoriesJson: A JSON list of objects with `ownedBeaconPlist` and
        `namingRecordPlist`, each an XML plist as the app stores it, and optionally
        `alignmentPlist`. The naming record is **not** optional: the importer inner-joins the two
        and silently drops an accessory it cannot pair with one.
    :param via: `OpenTagViewer.android:<versionName>`. Passed from Java rather than built here,
        because `build_export` refuses to invent it and the version lives in `BuildConfig`.
    :param sourceUser: What the recipient sees as "exported by". A label, never an Apple ID.
    :param exportedAtMs: Milliseconds since the epoch, passed rather than read from the clock.
    :returns: JSON. On success, `entries` maps each path in the zip to its base64 content, and
