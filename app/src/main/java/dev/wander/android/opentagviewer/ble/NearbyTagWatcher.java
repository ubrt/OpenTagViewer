/**
 * Reports the user's own tags as this phone hears them, for as long as somebody is subscribed.
 *
 * <p><b>Who runs it decides what it costs.</b> A screen subscribes in {@code onResume} and
 * disposes in {@code onPause}, so the radio is on only while somebody is looking - that is the
 * default, and it keeps the app a display feature. {@code NearbyScanService} runs the same class
 * continuously when the user turns background scanning on, which is a recording feature and is
 * why it is opt-in and carries a permanent notification.
 *
 * <p>The difference reaches this class as {@link #scanMode}, and the two callers sit at
 * opposite ends of it. A screen is open because somebody is looking for a tag right now, so it
 * scans at {@code SCAN_MODE_LOW_LATENCY} - the radio listening continuously, which is what makes
 * the signal meter move as you walk toward something. That is affordable precisely because a
 * screen is open for minutes, not days.
 *
 * <p>The service takes {@code SCAN_MODE_BALANCED} instead: a quarter of the radio time, running
 * all day. Cheaper still exists, and was tried - low power left gaps of over a minute with a tag
 * in a pocket, which the left-behind rule then has to see through, and every gap it cannot costs
 * a full-power verification burst of its own.
 *
 * <p>{@code SCAN_MODE_BALANCED} - a middle ground between the low-latency mode
 * {@link NearbyAccessoryScanner} uses and this class's own original {@code SCAN_MODE_LOW_POWER}.
 * Low-power's short scan window and multi-second sleep between them meant several of a tag's
 * own advertisements arrived in a burst whenever a window happened to line up, then nothing for
 * several seconds until the next one - honest about what low-power scanning actually looks
 * like, but a person watching this screen is specifically looking for a tag right now, the same
 * reason {@link NearbyAccessoryScanner} justifies its own higher power draw. Still not
 * low-latency: this runs for as long as a screen stays open rather than for a few bounded
 * seconds after a tap, so it keeps some of the duty cycle low-latency forgoes entirely.
