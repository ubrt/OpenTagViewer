/**
 * Keeps listening for the owner's tags while the app is closed.
 *
 * <p><b>Opt-in, and that is not caution for its own sake.</b> Everything else in this app
 * listens only while a screen is open, which makes it a display feature. This one records: it
 * runs continuously, writes down where tags were heard, and shows a permanent notification for
 * as long as it does. The people who install an app to avoid Apple's tracking network have
 * specific reasons to decide that for themselves rather than receive it in an update.
 *
 * <p><b>It is also what makes the local position history worth having.</b> The question a
 * history answers is "where did I leave it", and the app is shut at exactly that moment. Without
 * this, the history records where somebody was while they had the app open, which is mostly at
 * home with the tag in their pocket.
 *
 * <p><b>A foreground service because Android gives no other way.</b> A background scan without
 * one is throttled to the point of uselessness, and from Android 14 the service must declare
 * what it is for - {@code location}, since it reads the phone's position to attribute a sighting.
 * The permanent notification is the price of that, and it is honest: something is listening.
 *
 * <p>Same {@link NearbyTagWatcher} and the same {@code SCAN_MODE_BALANCED} the screens use.
 * Low power was the obvious choice for a service that runs all day - a tenth of the radio time
 * against a quarter - but it produced gaps of over a minute while a tag sat in a pocket, and a
 * gap is what the left-behind rule has to see through. Fewer gaps also means fewer verification
 * bursts at full power, so the cheaper mode is not obviously the cheaper answer.
 *
 * <p><b>Which of the two actually costs less has not been measured yet</b>, and the duty cycles
 * alone do not settle it. Worth making the user's choice once there is a number to put beside
 * it.
